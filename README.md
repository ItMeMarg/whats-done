# What's Done
*Whatâ€™s Done* is a customizable site built to help users remember simple tasks that can be forgotten due to thoughtless repetition. For example, were those finicky plants watered this week, or was that last? What about those supposed daily vitamins? While countless journals and apps boast features to track and analyze user-inputted data, this siteâ€™s appeal is its simplicity. Users fully customize habits tracked, the labels and icons associated to those habits, as well as the color theme. 

## UX
### Project Goals
I am building this project to take the pressure out of habit trackingâ€”so many of the apps Iâ€™ve tried using have seemed too daunting. Not only are you supposed to track X multiple times per day, but itâ€™s also necessitated that you reflect on how youâ€™re doing emotionally and mentally every time you even look at your phone. Is that healthy? I mean, probably yes. But thatâ€™s not what Iâ€™m looking for. I want to know if I took my medicine this morning, or if I cut the catâ€™s nails this week. Iâ€™m not looking to Big Data myself, I just want basic reference for myself.
#### User Goals
As a user, I expect simple login and data entry. 
As a user, I expect data and customization to be saved. 
As a user, I expect to access my data no matter the device Iâ€™m using.
As a user, I expect to easily reference my entered data. 

#### Site Owner Goals
Ensure the site is designed to be navigated and manipulated intuitively. 
Ensure user data is saved and available. 
Ensure the site can be accessed across devices. 
Ensure users have a variety of customization available, from access to labeling habit icons to choice of color theme. 

### Design Choices
#### Fonts
One font, [Oxygen](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Oxygen), is used in varying weights as needed.  

#### Icons
Icons are used to convey intuitive site navigation, including âž• for adding new categories and ðŸ‘¤ for account access.  

#### Colors

![Classic Color Palette](https://github.com/ItMeMarg/whats-done/blob/main/wireframe/colors_classic.png?raw=true)

In offering two color schemes, I referenced a list of 2021 Colors of The Year featured by [W3Schools](w3schools.com/w3css/w3css_color_fashion.asp). The 15 colors listed were a bit much, so I minimized the list to four, offering a dark and a light mode.

##### Dark Mode
* *Inkwell* HEX #363945: siteâ€™s background
* *French Blue* HEX#0072B5: interactive feature color
* *Buttercream* #EFE1CE: contrasting color

![Light mode color template](https://github.com/ItMeMarg/whats-done/blob/main/wireframe/light_mode.png?raw=true)
##### Light Mode
* *Buttercream* #EFE1CE: siteâ€™s background
* *Marigold* HEX#FDAC53: interactive feature color
* *Inkwell* HEX #363945: contrasting color

## Wireframes
Before putting code to IDE, I used [Justinmind](https://www.justinmind.com/prototyping-tool) to create examples of features on [mobile](/workspace/whats-done/wireframe/mobile), [tablet](/workspace/whats-done/wireframe/tablet), and [desktop](/workspace/whats-done/wireframe/desktop).

## Features
### Existing Features
* Mandatory Account Creation
  * User input is saved to their account for later reference. 
  * Customizations, such as habits being tracked and color theme preference, are saved. 

* Habit Icons
  * Shown prominently on the home page, users are encouraged to interact with their habit tracker. 
  * Users are able to organize the order of habit icons.

* Tracking Calendar 
  * A filled-in circle over a date indicates a habit was performed; lack of a circle means it was not. This simple differentiation makes referencing as easy as possible. 

### Future Features
Share data
  * Future feature would allow users to share their data by email or text.
